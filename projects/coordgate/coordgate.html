Convolution is the operation of applying a filter to an image to extract features. In the mathematically strict sense, convolution is translationally equivariant, meaning that the same filter is applied at every spatial location in the image. Thus, one might expect that a network built solely from convolutional layers (such as one used for segmentation) would be unable to learn spatially-varying features, such as detecting an object in the top-left corner but not in the bottom-right corner.
