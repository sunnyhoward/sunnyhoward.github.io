            There is now some strong evidence that LLMs can introspect, which is analogous (or equivalent) to models being aware of their thoughts. That feels like a long way from the calculator. The fact that simple learning algorithms like gradient descent can reproduce these phenomena, that feel so intimate and fundamental to what we take ourselves to be,

                When we try to qualify what this intuitive sense of a difference between us and AI is,  conscious, I think we have an intuitive sense of bundling in all of our experiences. 

                The context of having an experience, and the content of the experience, are separable. AI will be able to reproduce all reactions of the content of experience. All we are as humans, are rocks rolling down a hill, but we experience it.
